This project introduces a Human Resources Management System developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporating ASP.NET Core 6, Identity, and Entity Framework Core technologies. This system is designed to facilitate and optimize the management of human resources in businesses.
## Features

- Companies and Administrators: Company administrators can oversee company operations. Tasks such as personnel management, permissions, advances, and adding jobs are carried out here.

- Personnel Operations: Employees can perform operations such as leave requests, advance requests, and expense tracking. They can also keep track of their transaction history.
